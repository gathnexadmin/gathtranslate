Google Translate API

This tool is easy to use and doesn't require an API key. It's free and straightforward. You can translate either a short text or a whole file, but the text must be 5000 characters or fewer. If your text is longer, you can divide it into chunks of 5000 characters and translate them separately.

Google Translate works with 108 different languages. You can select any language as the source or target language. If you don't specify the source language, the tool will automatically detect it. You can also translate multiple languages simultaneously using this tool. For a detailed list of supported languages, click here: Supported Languages
