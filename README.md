Google translate API

This library does not need an api key or something else to use, it's free and simple. You can either use a string or a file to translate but the text must be equal to or less than 5000 character. You can split your text into 5000 characters to translate more.

Google Translate supports 108 different languages. You can use any of them as source and target language in this application. If source language is not specified, it will detect source language automatically. This application supports multi thread translation, you can use it to translate multiple languages at once. Detailed language list can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages
